To replicate 90s vibe, I used real image assets from websites of that timeline.

## I made...

- The star background of the website.
- The 'Welcome to my homepage' text.

## GifCities

I've used [a websited called 'GifCities'](https://gifcities.org/) to search for GIF files that match my content. Thanks a lot to the providers!!
